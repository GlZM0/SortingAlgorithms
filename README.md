# Sorting Algorithms

Simple application where you can use one of the most popular sorting algorithms. It generates how many numbers you want, and from any range you want. Next you can choose how fast it will sort your input and which algorithm you want to use.

## Running a project

```bash

# start the server
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
